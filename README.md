# Client-Server-TCP
Command line client and server applications that allow any kind of file to be uploaded or downloaded between the client and the server using stream type
sockets over TCP. The server is multi-threaded, and use one thread per client connection. The client has a command line argument that allows the user to specify whether to upload or download a file, as well as the file name. It uses -u to indicate an upload operation and -d to indicate a download operation.
